Business logic should be placed here.\n     Repository: implementation of a persistence engine (blob, SQL, ...).\n\n     My design goal with this was to separate business objects, serialization and persistence. The DAL is the application-facing implementation that deals with business objects, while the Repository is an abstraction of a persistence engine. The DAL can perform serialization in one place while supporting many persistence engines. The repository is meant to deal with simple or primitive types to avoid containing business logic, it should just pass data into storage and do nothing more.\n\n     My code review shows one DAL and one repository (and a commented SQL repository) for the MapConfig business object. In the future, when we add new business objects (job schedules, on/off switch, admin settings, etc), they will get their own DAL and Repository implementations and not be bundled into the interfaces presented here. That is, it is a pattern to follow and not a framework.\n", work_item_ids="39534" }

{ owner:"greglu",  commit_ticks:"635252316732030000", comment:"Plan B for 35200- PAGO assignment\n\n1) There's now a new domain object that we should've always had- policy family.\na. For each family version of a policy, there's a corresponding PolicyFamily object, keyed off of Pspdentifier. We should've had this for custom procedures, etc. anyways.\nb. The PolicyFamily has an optional set of BackupSecurityGroups which can be specified.\nc. Right now, we're populating this thing through data upgrade.\ni. To do: Talk to Gena/Robin/Marvels,  add a field to policies in QECM, and plumb it through. Until then, this thing is manually maintained. Its absence has no effect on non-PAGO policies and its presence supports only this, but this is necessary work to maintain.\n2) Through a view, the new policy family backup SG property grants all implicit PA permissions, but does not get fetched when sending notifications.\n3) There's now two modes to our PAGO contacts assignment:\na. Mode 1: Ordinary functioning, as per the requirements.\ni. Candidate PAs are: All the folks fetched by the PAGO Contacts DB, which are all TwcStrategists for that policy, regardless of org relationship.\nii. Candidate PEs are: All the folks fetched by the PAGO Contacts DB, specific to your org, plus all the candidates in the candidate PA list.\niii. PA/PE assignments are validated against the PAGO Contacts DB, but ONLY the selected contacts. You can manually add an invalid BG to the list in the UI, but it won't let you save the person unless the PAGO Contacts DB validates it.\niv. Members of the backup SG have implicit PA permissions everywhere, but don't receive mails.\nb. Mode 2: The PAGO Contacts DB goes down for an extended period- we have the option to activate a new FCK- "EnablePagoContactsDbOutageFallbackPlan" on the AT (no client-side FCK). When this thing is active, two changes occur:\ni. We (obviously) can't fetch contacts from the DB, so they don't show up.\nii. We don't validate any new PA/PE assignments against the PAGO Contacts DB as long as the FCK is active.\niii. We include the members of the backup security group as eligible PAs (which means they're also eligible PEs) without regard to their permissions in the PAGO Contacts DB (which we can't query).\niv. Something we might consider doing: Disable the "add BG contact" button while in this mode to avoid PAs taking advantage of the confusion to assign inappropriate contacts.\nc. Once we disable the contacts DB fallback FCK, here's what happens (assume we assigned people from the backup SG who aren't in the PAGO contacts DB)\ni. When you go into assignment and attempt to assign, we once again validate against the PAGO Contacts DB and tell you which contacts aren't valid.\nii. Assignments remain until someone removes them, including permissions.\nd. If the PAGO Contacts DB goes down and we don't have the FCK set, the PA/PE assignment boxes will be empty. C'est la vie. We have logging in place, if we're paying attention, to tell us this is happening before a customer complains.\n\nStill to-do: \n1) Data upgrade\n2) QECM/publishing to support policy family.\n***NO_CI***\n", work_item_ids="35200" }

Upon opening a policy, the organizations in the profile get set to "all organizations" rather than the proper subset of organizations.\n\n     Organizations are implemented strangely; rather than having a way to say "all organizations", "all orgs" is specified by listing each organization individually. A bit of code was written to automatically add each of the orgs when editing a new policy, but FWICT, the condition that it uses to determine that the policy is new works fine if everything else works, but if there are errors or timing issues (both seem to be reasonable candidates; we have not been able to repro this on dev boxes), the code thinks that the policy is new and turns on every organization.\n\n     We are replacing the current organization approach with the PAQ work that is currently under way, so all of the org code will be going away to the big bit-bucket in the sky. Until that happens, I've made a small change to remove the code that sets all of the orgs on new policies; Gena and I think this is better behavior anyway.\n", work_item_ids="39570" }
