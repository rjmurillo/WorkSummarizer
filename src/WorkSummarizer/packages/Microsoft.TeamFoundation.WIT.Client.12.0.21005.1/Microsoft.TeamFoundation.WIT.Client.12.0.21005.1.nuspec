    <description>The TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client namespace provides the APIs that are required to enable a client computer or application to work with user stories, requirements, tasks, bugs, and other types of work items.

         The WorkItemStore represents the connection to the repository of work items on Visual Studio Team Foundation Server. The WorkItem object contains Fields that store data, Attachments that represent files, and WorkItemLinks that connect to other work items. The following example code demonstrates how to access a “User Story” work item type on a work item store.

         The Query class represents a query to the WorkItemStore. An executed query returns a WorkItemCollection, which contains the work items that satisfy the query.

         The WorkItemType class defines a work item. The FieldDefinition class defines a field in a work item. The WorkItemLinkType class defines a WorkItemLink, which links two work items.</description>
